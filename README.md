# Advent of Code Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). In this repository, I have solved various challenges from Advent of Code using both **C++** and **Python**. The solutions are organized by year and day, with each solution tailored to the problem it solves.

## Programming Languages

### C++

Some of the problems are solved using **C++**. The C++ solutions are written to be compiled with **g++ 14**. I use the `bits/stdc++` header, so please note that if you're trying to compile the code with another compiler, you may encounter compatibility issues. If you're working in a different environment, I recommend adjusting the include headers accordingly.

#### Requirements:

- **g++ 14** or later
- The C++ standard library
- `bits/stdc++` header (specific to the environment, might need modification)

### Python

Other solutions are implemented in **Python**. These scripts are written for **Python 3.10** and are meant to be run with this version or later.

#### Requirements:

- **Python 3.10** or later
